/// Policy for advancing the account's durable transport cursor

///
/// A runtime-construction policy, not a per-call switch: it is fixed on
/// [`MarmotAppConfig`] and applies to every account client the resulting
/// `MarmotApp`/`MarmotAppRuntime` opens for that construction's lifetime.
///
/// * [`Advance`](Self::Advance) — the default, normal posture: every ingested
///   kind-445 advances the in-memory cursor (clamp-then-monotonic-max, see
///   `client/sync.rs`). A completed transport drain promotes that candidate to
///   the durable floor; isolated live-delivery projection saves retain the last
///   drain checkpoint so a later bounded-queue overflow cannot strand an older
///   delivery below an already-persisted newest-first cursor.
/// * [`Frozen`](Self::Frozen) — the wake-collection posture (iOS NSE,
///   notification reply/mark-read actions: full runtimes with a sub-second
///   drain budget on cold sockets). A `Frozen` pass still ingests, decrypts,
///   and projects everything; it only cannot move the durable floor. The
///   in-memory cursor never advances, so every `save_state` writes back the
///   loaded value, and the save-time clamp-then-max merge in
///   `storage_sqlite::save_account_projection_state` guarantees that write can
///   never lower a cursor a concurrent `Advance` runtime has moved. The cursor
///   is still *loaded* and still derives the subscription `since` floor —
///   `Frozen` means "never advance", not "no cursor". Worst case is bounded
///   redelivery on the next `Advance` catch-up, absorbed by seen-id dedup.
///
/// `Frozen` severs the cursor ratchet at the wake-collection trigger:
/// a wake pass that drains for a fraction of a second on cold sockets must
/// not persist a floor above events it never had time to receive.
